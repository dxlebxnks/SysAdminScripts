Create a directory in Linux you want to share
Before you configure anything with Samba, you will need to create a directory on your Linux server that you will want to share. For this example, we will use /srv/samba. To create this directory:

Use the command: sudo mkdir /srv/samba
Now, make that directory world writable and world browsable via: sudo chmod a+rwx /srv/samba
Go to the bottom of the file, and add the following:
[Anonymous]

path = /srv/samba
browseable = yes
writable = yes
read only = no

guest ok = yes

Save that file, and restart Samba with this command: sudo systemctl restart smbd
You should be able to reach those shares from any machine on your network.
